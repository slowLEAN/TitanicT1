This project involves cleaning and preprocessing the Titanic dataset to prepare it for analysis or machine learning tasks. The key steps performed include:

Loading the dataset and exploring its structure, data types, and missing values.

Handling missing data by dropping columns with too many missing values and filling missing values in numerical and categorical columns.

Encoding categorical variables into numerical formats suitable for modeling.

Normalizing and standardizing numerical features to improve model performance.

Visualizing data distributions and removing outliers to ensure data quality.

Saving the cleaned dataset for further use.
